iris data analysis using R

3 species of iris flower were analyzed based on :

• Petal Length vs Petal Width

	and

• Sepal Length vs Sepal Width 


From the analysis made we can come to the following conclusions: - 

1)In the Petal Length Vs Petal width analysis, we can see that in every increase in petal length, there’s an increase in petal width as well making it directly proportional.

2)In the Sepal Length Vs Sepal width analysis, we can see that the scattering is ambiguous, hence a null hypothesis can be performed, i.e. we assume that the changes are due to random chance. 

3)The Box plot gives us a Positive skewness with respect to the Iris Data. 

4)In the Histogram, can see the statistics, the frequency and the density of the species of Iris
